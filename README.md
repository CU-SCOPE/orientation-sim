# orientation-sim

Initial orientation simulation implementation in python. Currently working but very limited # of test scenarios have been used

## Usage
Test by running `icp.py`. Change the frame in this file if desired. New frames can be created in blender using the `baseline.blend`
file in `frames/` but blensor extension must be installed.

## Todo
- Create/test more scenarios to get better idea of actual performance/robustness
- Write better python code, because loops are SLOW in python
